## Abstract
Recent research has explored complex loss functions for deblurring. In this work, we explore the impact of a previously introduced loss function â€“ $Q$ which explicitly addresses sharpness and employ it to fine-tune State-of-the-Art (SOTA) deblurring models. Standard image quality metrics such as PSNR or SSIM do not distinguish sharpness from ringing. Therefore, we propose a novel full-reference image quality metric $\Omega$ that combines PSNR
with Q. This metric is sensitive to ringing artifacts, but not to a slight increase in sharpness, thus making it a fair metric for comparing restorations from deblurring mechanisms. Our approach shows an increase of 15% in sharpness (Q) and up to 10% in $\Omega$ over the use of standard losses.
